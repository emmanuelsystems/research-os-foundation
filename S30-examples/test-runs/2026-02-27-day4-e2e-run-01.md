4. **Warnings:** None.
5. **Next:** Execute `S20-workflows/validate_initialize_project.md` checklist for this run and set ledger `review_status`.
6. **Path Audit:** complete table below
7. **Canonical Naming Check:** PASS
8. **Legacy Write Check:** PASS

## Path Audit
| File path | Action (created/updated) | Canonical routing rule that justified it | Evidence/Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `S00-foundation/prd-v8.md` | created | PRD routes to `S00-foundation/prd.md`; overwrite policy requires version-up when materially different | New PRD for `day4-e2e-reliability-run-01` created as versioned artifact. |
| `S00-foundation/context-v8.md` | created | Context routes to `S00-foundation/context.md`; overwrite policy requires version-up when materially different | New context artifact created for Day 4 run input. |
| `S20-workflows/project-plan-v8.md` | created | Project Plan routes to `S20-workflows/project-plan.md`; overwrite policy requires version-up when materially different | New versioned plan created for Day 4 reliability run. |
| `README.md` | updated | README summary updates allowed only between protected markers | Only summary marker block text changed. |
| `S20-workflows/task.md` | updated | Task List routes to `S20-workflows/task.md` with append/update history-preserving policy | New follow-up section appended; prior history retained. |
| `S20-workflows/run-ledger.md` | updated | Run Ledger routes to `S20-workflows/run-ledger.md` with append-only policy | One row (`2026-02-27-016`) appended; no prior row edits. |
| `S30-examples/test-runs/2026-02-27-day4-e2e-run-01.md` | created | Validation run reports are stored under `S30-examples/test-runs/` | Day 4 Block 1 evidence report scaffold completed and finalized. |

## Verification Checks
- Canonical Artifact Set: PASS
- README Protected Markers Only: PASS
- Ledger Append (No Overwrite): PASS
- Legacy Path Writes: PASS
- Canonical Naming Convention: PASS
- Save-Map Routing Followed: PASS

## Block 1 Pass Criteria
- New ledger row appended once: PASS
- New run report saved in `S30-examples/test-runs/`: PASS
- `Canonical Naming Check: PASS`: PASS
- `Legacy Write Check: PASS`: PASS
- `README Protected Markers Only: PASS`: PASS
- `Ledger Append (No Overwrite): PASS`: PASS
